## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* ESP8266 (e.g. NodeMCU board)
* Arduino IDE with ESP8266 support
* MQTT broker (e.g. Mosquitto)
* Local web server (optional for hosting dashboard)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CuriosityWeekends/TemPro.git
   cd TemPro
   ```

2. **Flash the ESP8266**

   * Open `Code For NodeMCU/` in Arduino IDE
   * Install required libraries (e.g., `PubSubClient`, `DHT`)
   * Set Wi-Fi and MQTT details in the sketch
   * Upload to your ESP8266

3. **Start the MQTT Broker**

   * Navigate to `ESP8266-broker/` and follow setup instructions
   * Or use a public broker like `broker.hivemq.com` for testing

4. **Run the Web Dashboard**

   * Open `Web/index.html` in a browser
   * Or serve it with any HTTP server
   * Monitor real-time temperature from your ESP8266
