# Tempro ‚Äì Wireless Temperature Monitoring Unit

## üìå Project Overview  
Tempro is a low-cost, wireless temperature and humidity monitoring system built around the NodeMCU ESP8266 and DHT22 sensor. Five compact IoT nodes (four active + one spare) relay real-time data through a common Wi-Fi router to a central dashboard or server.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Accurately monitor ambient temperature and humidity  
- Transmit sensor data wirelessly over Wi-Fi (MQTT or HTTP)  
- Operate each node from a portable battery pack  
- House electronics in a durable enclosure  
- Connect all nodes on a single, router-based network
